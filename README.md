# Happy international womens' day (8th March)

## Description
This is a simple website with cute - pinked theme design pattern, that I personally used to gift to some special person of mine, to congratulate her on such event

### Features 
1. There is a background with confetti raining continuously
2. A Controll panell to select a 3D model or (gift) as in element description
3. > You can spin the model and adjust the spinning speed
4. 2x 3D models, that are implemented using three.js, so you can also interact with them via touch or mouse
5. There is a button at the bottom, if pressed -> calls a notification with some very heartwarming words

----------------------------------

Please do not forget to update the following line in index.html:
```confirmButtonText: "💝 Thank you, [INSERT_NAME]! 💝", //please insert the Name of the recieving person here```

Or your reciever, will be very confused (or upset that you forgot her/his name)
So be carefull

You might also want to change the Notification message, and write something more personal, so that it adds up to the deep value, when the words are coming from your heart

----------------------------------
